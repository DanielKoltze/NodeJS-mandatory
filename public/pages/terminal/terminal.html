        Git is a powerful version control system that is widely used to
        collaborate on projects. To use git in the terminal we first have to
        install it. After the installation we can check if git was succesfully
        downloaded by writing
        <span class="terminal-span">git --version</span> in the terminal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we are able to use a bunch of git commands! Here is an explanation
        of the most commonly used once:
      </p>
      <p>
        1. <span class="terminal-span">git init</span>: initializes a new Git
        repository in the currenty working directory.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. <span class="terminal-span">git add "file/directory"</span>: adds
        changes to the staging area. You can specify a single file or directory,
        or use ".", "*" or "-A" to add all changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. <span class="terminal-span"> git commit -m "commit message"</span>:
        commits the changes in the staging area with a commit message.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. <span class="terminal-span"> git status</span>: shows the current
        status of the repository, including which files have been modified or
        staged.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. <span class="terminal-span"> git pull</span>: downloads changes from
        a remote repository.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. <span class="terminal-span"> git push</span>: uploads local changes
        to a remote repository.
      </p>

      <br />

        Just like before, we have to download NodeJS before we can use it and
        the commands that go with it. If this is done succesfully we should be
        able to check the version by typing
        <span class="terminal-span">node --verision</span> in the terminal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once this is installed navigate to your project directory in the
        terminal and run npm init. This will create a package.json file, which
        will contain information about your project and its dependencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        To install packages we can write
        <span class="terminal-span">npm i "package name"</span>.
